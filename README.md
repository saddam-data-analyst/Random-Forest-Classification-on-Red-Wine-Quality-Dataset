# Random-Forest-Classification-on-Red-Wine-Quality-Dataset
This project demonstrates how to implement a Random Forest Classifier to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. Using the popular Red Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this notebook walks through the full machine learning pipeline â€” from data loading to model evaluation.
